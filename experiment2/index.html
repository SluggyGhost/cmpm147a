				<p>Create a procedurally generated scene inspired by real life.</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>
					The sky, grass, and even the lake are just simple rectangles, though the lake has rounded corners, with the sharpness of the corners randomly determined. 
					The mountain range in the background is a custom-shaped polygon. It has parameters to ensure that no slopes are greater than 90 degrees.
					Additionally, all vertices for this polygon are not in fixed locations, but confined to a small area with randomized values. 
					The concept of populating an area with randomized object locations was done for the trees and the flowers.
					However, the trees are actually populating three separate areas in different sizes, to create the illusion of depth. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The most difficult part to implement was definitely the splash trail on the lake. After finding code that created a cursor trail,
					I then modified it to only create new trails when the cursor is over the lake, and tied the lifetime of the trail objects to a time variable,
					to ensure that they shrunk and faded consistently.
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					I spent a lot of time trying to find the perfect inspirational image. 
					I looked at images from space, from nature, and from paintings. I tried many search parameters. 
					And in the end, I went with a photo from Wikipedia. Funny how that worked out. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I actually forgot that there needed to be a custom-shaped polygon in this assignment, and tried to do the mountain range with a row of triangles at first. 
					It was only after I was satisfied with it that I realized that I needed a non-primitive polygon, and the mountain range was the best fit for it, 
					similar to the professor's example. So I unfortunately had to scrap that piece of code. I wish I had thought to save it somewhere before I deleted it.
				</p>
				<p>
					The trees and flowers were easy to figure out once I had the code to populate a specific area with objects. 
					Just make a certain shape tied to a constrained random variable. Not too difficult. 
					I considered copying the effect that the professor used on the trees in his example on the flowers from mine, 
					making the effect of flowers in the wind. I decided against it, as I felt it was straying too far from what the original scene was depicting.
				</p>
				<p>
					While it was the hardest part to do, the lake effect is definitely my favorite part of the scene. 
					It just makes it feel so alive, and I think it turned out really well.
				</p>
