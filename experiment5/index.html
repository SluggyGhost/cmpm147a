				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>According to the assignment, this is a generator that directly reads images, 
					and renders a parameterized version, adjusting designs to optimize a better score. 
					In essence, it seems to use colors and shapes to create an image that acts like a shadow 
					of the inspiration.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I'll be honest. I don't really understand how this thing works. 
					Having ChatGPT try to explain it to me didn't help. 
					Asking friends in the class to explain it didn't help. 
					After loading my images, I just copied most of the code from the example.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I feel like I would have done better on this assignment if I could understand it better. 
					As it is now, I don't really understand what we were trying to accomplish with this. 
					Or even how a single piece of it works. 
					While all of the experiments have forced me to learn new concepts, I feel like I was unable to 
					learn anything new from this one, and certainly not for lack of trying.
