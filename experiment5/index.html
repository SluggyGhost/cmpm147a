				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This program creates an infinite tilemap populated with terrain and environment sprites. It is an evolution of Experiment 4b.</p>

				<h3>Infinity</h3>
				<p>I used the infinite extent of my world to represent a  minecraft world. 
					In minecraft, all worlds are theoreticially infinite, as the edge is impossible to reach. So it is with this one.
				</p>
				<h3>Variation in Space</h3>
				<p>As the audience browses my world, theyâ€™ll see variations in ground type (dirt, grass and water) and natural objects (rocks and trees).</p>
				<h3>Variation in Key</h3>
				<p>Different worlds will have different generation patterns. The generation of terrain and objects are directly tied to 
					the world seed.</p>
				<h3>Signs of Life</h3>
				<p>Clicking tiles causes a building to be placed on the tile, if the tile is empty. Repeated clicks changes the building, 
					and eventually removes it. It cycles through three styles of houses, a smithy, a windmill, and a tower. 
					The smithy releases puffs of smoke at regular intervals, and the mill's blades spin in unseen wind. 
					Building placement information is retained; if the world seed changes, tiles that 
					were clicked on, but had an obstacle present, may now be empty save for a building. This also works in the opposite 
					direction; if a building tile now has an obstacle due to a change in world seed, the building will be replaced with the 
					natural object.</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Most of the heavy lifting is done by engine.js. It uses a complicated hash algorithm, along with p5.js functions 
					randomSeed() and noiseSeed(), to create randomness. This randomness (and the world seed) is used to place the terrain and natural objects. 
					The house placement keeps track of the number of clicks to place a house. No house sprite is placed if a natural decoration exists on that tile.
					Just getting the images to show up on the grid took a bit of finagling. </p>
				<p>
					I also had to mess with the proportions of the image to ensure that it aligned to the grid properly, 
					which took a lot of messing around with the specific proportions. 
					This was repeated for each sprite image, due to the variety of shapes and sizes.
					The mill blades and smoke puff both work off of the frame count. The puff moves up and down on a sine wave, 
					while the blades swap between two still images repeatedly, creating the illusion of movement.
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>As this was the final one created, I was able to bring in a bit more of what I wanted the minecraft generator to be. 
					I brought in elevation and more buildings. Unfortunately, I ran out of time for my more ambitious additions, 
					such as binding certain building types to hotkeys, or multi-tile structures like castles, lakes, rives and roads. 
					Still, I think I'm overall satisfied with how I did. Though I definitely would have moved the sprite placement to a 
					separate function, if I did this one (and the previous one) again.
