				<h3>Infinity</h3>
				<p>I used the infinite extent of my world to represent a superflat minecraft world.</p>
				<h3>Variation in Space</h3>
				<p>As the audience browses my world, theyâ€™ll see variations in ground type and naturally generated rocks and trees.</p>
				<h3>Variation in Key</h3>
				<p>Different worlds will have different generation patterns. The generation of stones and trees is directly tied to the world seed.</p>
				<h3>Signs of Life</h3>
				<p>Clicking tiles causes a house to be placed on the tile, if the tile is empty. 
					Repeated clicks changes the color of the roof, and eventually removes the house. 
					This information is retained; if the world seed changes, tiles that were clicked on, but had an obstacle present, may now be empty save for a house. 
					This also works in the opposite direction; if a house tile now has an obstacle due to a change in world seed, the house will be replaced with the natural object.</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Just getting the images to show up on the grid took a bit of finagling. 
					I also had to mess with the proportions of the image to ensure that it aligned to the grid properly, 
					which took a lot of messing around with the specific proportions. 
					This was repeated for each sprite image, due to the variety of shapes and sizes.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This one was much harder than the first one in comparison. 
					I had to make this one much more simple than I originally envisioned.
