				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This program creates an infinite tilemap populated with terrain and environment sprites.</p>

				<h3>Infinity</h3>
				<p>I used the infinite extent of my world to represent a superflat minecraft world. 
					In minecraft, all worlds are theoreticially infinite, as the edge is impossible to reach. So it is with this one. 
					It is called 'superflat' because there is no terrain elevation; everything is on a plane of flat ground.
				</p>
				<h3>Variation in Space</h3>
				<p>As the audience browses my world, theyâ€™ll see variations in ground type (dirt and grass) and natural objects (rocks and trees).</p>
				<h3>Variation in Key</h3>
				<p>Different worlds will have different generation patterns. The generation of stones and trees is directly tied to 
					the world seed.</p>
				<h3>Signs of Life</h3>
				<p>Clicking tiles causes a house to be placed on the tile, if the tile is empty. Repeated clicks changes the color 
					of the roof, and eventually removes the house. This information is retained; if the world seed changes, tiles that 
					were clicked on, but had an obstacle present, may now be empty save for a house. This also works in the opposite 
					direction; if a house tile now has an obstacle due to a change in world seed, the house will be replaced with the 
					natural object.</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Most of the heavy lifting is done by engine.js. It uses a complicated hash algorithm, along with p5.js functions 
					randomSeed() and noiseSeed(), to create randomness. This randomness (and the world seed) is used to place the terrain and natural objects. 
					The house placement keeps track of the number of clicks to place a house. No house sprite is placed if a natural decoration exists on that tile.</p>
				<p>Just getting the images to show up on the grid took a bit of finagling. 
					I also had to mess with the proportions of the image to ensure that it aligned to the grid properly, 
					which took a lot of messing around with the specific proportions. 
					This was repeated for each sprite image, due to the variety of shapes and sizes.
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This one was much harder than the first one in comparison. 
					I had to make this one much more simple than I originally envisioned.
