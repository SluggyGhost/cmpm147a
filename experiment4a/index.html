				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This program creates an infinite color gradient.</p>

				<h3>Infinity</h3>
				<p>I used the infinite extent of my world to represent an infinite color gradient. 
					I based the idea off the reference image, which is an infinite gradient noise fractal.</p>
				<h3>Variation in Space</h3>
				<p>As the audience browses my world, theyâ€™ll see colors shifting and changing, forming a smooth, infinite gradient.</p>
				<h3>Variation in Key</h3>
				<p>Different worlds will have different color patterns. It won't just be the colors themselves changing, but the way those colors form patterns.</p>
				<h3>Signs of Life</h3>
				<p>Clicking tiles changes the selected title to its complementary color.</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>A lot of the foundational work is done by <b>engine.js</b>, which is unchanged save for the canvas container names. 
					All of my changes in the code were done in <b>my_world.js</b>. 
					When drawing tiles, the code samples three different noise fields to get RGB values. 
					These values are multiplied by the colorNoiseScale, which is a low number, to result in a smooth gradient. 
					Changing the click effect was also simple. I changed the color to its complement by inverting the RGB values (255 - value).
				</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This was the one that I did first, to help me figure out how the program works. 
					It took a bit of work to try and find how to change the color according to the noise values. 
					Compared to that, replacing the clicked tile with the complement color was much easier. 
					It's not too flashy an effect, but I like the smooth colors. They remind me of brushstrokes of paintings.</p>
